# hyperparameter-tuning

## Background
Automated Machine Learning (also known as AutoML) refers to techniques for automatically discovering good performance machine learning models with very little user involvement.

Under this category, Hyperopt serves as a Python library that can perform hyper-parameter optimization with Bayesian optimization. It allows large scale of hyper-parameter optimization (e.g. hundreds of parameters).
